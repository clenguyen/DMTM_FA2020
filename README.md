# DMTM_FA2020
Data Mining and Text Mining Final Project, Fall 2020
Florida Polytechnic University

### Project Description:
This project provides text mining and analysis from COVID-19 tweets found in [this dataset](). This analysis utilizes tf-idf, LDA, and n-grams in order to create a better understanding of the feelings towards the novel coronavirus from March 16, 2020 to April 14, 2020. Future work on this project could explore sentiment drift further into the year. 

### Data
The data pulled from Kaggle dataset [here]() offers:
- `User_name`: deidentified as a number
- `Time`: dates in the form of DD-MM-YYYY dates
- `Location`: self-identified user location from twitter bio
- `text`: the tweet itself

For this analysis, the primary analysis uses  `text` to gather a sentiment overview. This data is stripped of punctuation, other tagged users, excape characters, and links in order to ensure data quality.
